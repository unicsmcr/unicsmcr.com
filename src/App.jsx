        <p>
          Our events are suited to every level of knowledge and all degree
          courses. If you are someone who is interested in knowing how they can
          use computers to see an idea come to life, UniCS is the society for
          you. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have never touched a computer or
          been programming for years, you will never be bored at our events. And
          if you still aren&#39;t convinced, we have free pizza (and
          occasionally drinks).
